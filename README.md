🏁 Getting Started
Climate Analysis and Exploration:

using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database.

Precipitation Analysis:

• Designing a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

• Selecting only the date and prcp values.

• Loading the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

• Plotting the results using the DataFrame plot method.

• Using Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

Station Analysis:

• Designing a query to calculate the total number of stations.

• Designing a query to find the most active stations.

• Designing a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

Climate App:

designing a Flask API based on the queries that we have just developed.

• A dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.

• A list of stations from the dataset.

• The dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.

• List of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for all dates greater than and equal to the given date.

• List of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for dates between the given start date and given end date.

Bonus Part - Temperature Analysis .
Temperature Analysis I:

• Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

• Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

• Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?

Temperature Analysis II:

• The starter notebook contains a function called calc_temps that will accept a start date and end date in the format %Y-%m-%d. The function will return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

• Using the calc_temps function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if the trip start date was "2018-01-01").

• Plotting the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart. o Using the average temperature as the bar height. o Using the peak-to-peak (TMAX-TMIN) value as the y error bar (YERR).

Daily Rainfall Average:

• Calculating the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

• Calculating the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.

• Creating a list of dates for the trip in the format %m-%d. Using the daily_normals function to calculate the normals for each date string and appending the results to a list.

• Loading the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index equal to the date.

• Using Pandas to plot an area plot (stacked=False) for the daily normals.
